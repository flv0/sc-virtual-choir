sc-virtual-choir
================

supercollider based virtual choir (harmonizer)

you can update the harmonizations while it's running

Current version depends on the PitchDetection sc3 plugin (Tartini UGEN),
since it seems to provide somewhat improved pitch detection over the standard algorithm.

See [my blog entry](http://a-touch-of-music.blogspot.be/2013/12/virtual-choir-auto-harmonize-your-voice.html "blog entry") for 
a version that works with the standard version of supercollider without plugins installed.
